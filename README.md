# Fake-News-Detector

## Project Overview
Fake news is a serious problem in today's digital world, where misinformation spreads quickly. This project aims to develop a Fake News Detection System using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify news articles as REAL or FAKE based on their text content.

## Dataset
We use the **Real and Fake News Dataset**, which consists of news articles labeled as real or fake. The dataset is preprocessed and tokenized using BERT's tokenizer.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- BERT (Hugging Face Transformers)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Installation & Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
2. Install dependencies:   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the training script:   python src/train.py
4. Evaluate the model:   python src/evaluate.py

## Model Performance
The model achieves **high accuracy** in classifying real vs. fake news. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated.
